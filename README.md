# Hi, I’m the BakeWizard 🍰

Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm the creator of **BakeKit**, a modern, developer-friendly CMS built on top of CakePHP. If you can make it, **bake** it!

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I started as a web developer building a simple online shop — but I quickly discovered that every project eventually needs the same things: authentication, admin panels, menus, roles, settings, and more. 

So instead of rebuilding the basics over and over again, I decided to bake something better.

Thus, **BakeKit** was born — a powerful, flexible CMS scaffold that makes it easy to build web apps with a clean admin panel and a modular foundation.

What began as a personal toolkit became something worth sharing with the world.
